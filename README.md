# Hydrodynamic Simulations of Supernova Remnants with PLUTO

We modelled the dynamical evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) by numerically solving the time-dependent Euler partial differential equations of fluid dynamics, also known as hyperbolic conservation laws.

Our simulations are performed by using the publicly available, Godunov-type code for astrophysical gas dynamics [PLUTO](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/). To overcome the spatial and temporal scale challenges in the problems considered, we rely on the block-structured, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation in the PLUTO code, based on the [Chombo](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations) library. The code uses a distributed infrastructure for parallel computations through the message passing interface (MPI) standard. We use the following set of [PLUTO](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/) standard algorithms: linear interpolation with default limiter, HLLC Riemann solver, RK2 for the time evolution, and MULTID flattening for the numerical dissipation near the strong shocks. We employ nine nested levels of resolution, with resolution increasing twofold at each refinement level, placed on a base (nonrefined) grid of 32^3, leading to a maximum AMR resolution of 16,384^3. In order to lower computational costs and keep them approximately constant as the blast wave expands, the maximum number of refinement levels decreases from nine (initial ejecta profile) to three (at the end of evolution). We record the shock position during the entire SNR evolution and consequently calculate the required number of refinement levels for a particular time, which is then forwarded to the Chombo library interface.

We developed [non-linear diffusive shock acceleration module](https://github.com/pmarkoo/PLUTO-hydrodinamics/blob/master/blasi.c), which runs parallel with [PLUTO](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/) code, simultaneously performs calculations of magnetic field amplification, synthesize the global radio emission in this amplified field and also accounts for the backreaction of accelerated cosmic rays on hydrodynamics. Non-linear effects on SNR hydrodynamics are visible only through the effective adiabatic index.
